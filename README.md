# Unexpected Behavior with Loose Equality and Null Values

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (==) comparisons involving null values.  The bug arises from the fact that loose equality does not always behave as expected when comparing values of different types.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function intends to add two numbers together. However, if either input is null, it should return 0. While the current implementation returns 0 for null inputs using `===` strict equality, it might produce unintended outcomes if it were using loose equality (`==`).  Loose equality can lead to incorrect comparisons and unexpected results when dealing with null, undefined, and other data types.
